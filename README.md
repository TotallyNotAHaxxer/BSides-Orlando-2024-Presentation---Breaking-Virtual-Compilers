# BSides 2024 Orlando Presentation - Breaking Virtual Compilers & Exercising Paradoxes

A presentation that has been in the making for quite some time, and something I have not liked putting off for as long as I have. This presentation covers some research I conducted a while back- starting from a simple issue when running personal code, to a CFP submission which got denied finally to fully exploring what was found. 

This repository holds the presentation.

> Further Note

A research paper will NOT be present here, however, specific parts of the research may be deeply explained
